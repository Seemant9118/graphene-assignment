## Description

This repository contains a landing page created using React.js, a popular JavaScript frontend library, and data fetching is implemented using React Query. The landing page is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience on various devices, including mobile screens such as the iPhone 12 Pro. It incorporates essential features like a hamburger menu, data fetching from an API, props drilling, and context management.

## Technologies Used

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/): A library for managing, caching, synchronizing, and sharing server state in React applications.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS): Cascading Style Sheets for styling the components.
- [API](https://example-api.com): Replace with the URL of the API you are fetching data from.

## Features

1. **Responsiveness**: The landing page is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on various screen sizes, including mobile devices like the iPhone 12 Pro.

2. **Hamburger Menu**: A hamburger menu is implemented for navigation on smaller screens, providing a user-friendly experience on mobile devices.

3. **Data Fetching**: Data is fetched from an external API using React Query, which offers a fast and reliable way to manage data fetching and state synchronization.

4. **Props Drilling**: Demonstrates the concept of props drilling, passing data and functions through component hierarchies to enable communication between parent and child components.

5. **Context Management**: Utilizes React's Context API to manage global state and share data and functionality across components efficiently.
